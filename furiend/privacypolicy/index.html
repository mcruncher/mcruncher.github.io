SUBSCRIPTION POLICY

PAYMENT 
Furiend+ is an auto-renewing subscription. A subscription is valid for 30 days and will automatically renew until cancelled. You can mange your subscription in the Manage Subscriptions section of your account settings. To learn more about cancelling your subscriptions, visit https://support.apple.com/HT202039. 

You will be notified if the price of a subscription increases and, if required, your consent will be required to continue. You will be charged no more than 24 hours prior to the start of the latest paid Subscription period. 

If your primary payment method cannot be charged for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), you authorize Apple to attempt to charge your other eligible payment methods in order from top to bottom as they appear on your account settings payments page. If we cannot charge you, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we may attempt to charge you again or request that you provide another payment method. For more details about how Transactions are billed, please visit http://support.apple.com/HT201359. 

We reserve the right to cancel your subscription if we are unable to successfully charge your payment method to renew your subscription. If you decide to unsubscribe from Furiend+ before we start charging your payment method, you will need to cancel the subscription at least 24 hours before the end of your subscription. When your subscription to Furiend+ ends, you will lose access to any functionality or content of that service.
