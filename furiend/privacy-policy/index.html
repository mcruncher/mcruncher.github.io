            Furiend+ is an auto-renewing subscription. A subscription is valid
            for 30 days and will automatically renew until cancelled. You can
            mange your subscription in the Manage Subscriptions section of your
            account settings. To learn more about cancelling your subscriptions,
            visit https://support.apple.com/HT202039. You will be notified if
            the price of a subscription increases and, if required, your consent
            will be required to continue. You will be charged no more than 24
            hours prior to the start of the latest paid Subscription period. If
            your primary payment method cannot be charged for any reason (such
            as expiration or insufficient funds), you authorize Apple to attempt
            to charge your other eligible payment methods in order from top to
            bottom as they appear on your account settings payments page.Â If we
            cannot charge you, you remain responsible for any uncollected
            amounts, and we may attempt to charge you again or request that you
            provide another payment method. For more details about how
            Transactions are billed, please visit http://support.apple.com/
